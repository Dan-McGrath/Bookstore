# Fullstack Digital Library

## Current Plans

1. Create complete frontend using React.js and testing to the best of my ability
2. Once the frontend is done I plan on creating a backend using Express.js also plan to have a testing environment

### Frontend

The plan for the frontend is to create a visual library to be able to see a display of the users books. This is something that will catelog the different books the user has read. It will allow users to click if they have read the full book or not. If the user has only read a portion of the book it will allow the user to select what page they have read to and update this number. 
I plan to use the Google books API to get the cover and other basic info. Basically its going to be a visual overhaul of what Google currently has.

### Backend

The plan for the back end is to set up a database to store the users basic info. It also will store the book info that the user adds to their library.
